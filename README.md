# Nucleotides sequences aligner
Aligns nucleic sequences to compare DNAs and RNAs

<br></br>
### needleman_wunsch module
Performs [Needleman-Wunsh algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needleman%E2%80%93Wunsch_algorithm) into two strings. 
These strings represent any nucleic acid sequences.
Instead of generating a score matrix, it generates a score map, where:
* __Map's Key__ is an 2-ple with Line and Column indexes of "score matrix"
* __Map's Value__ is an 2-ple with the position that generated the current score and the score itself.

<br></br>
### glorious_path module
Performs the [backingtracking analyzis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needleman%E2%80%93Wunsch_algorithm#Trace_Arrows_back_to_origin) into score map generated by *needleman_wunsch module*.
Generates a list with the path for the best alignment from score map.

<br></br>
### nucleic_acid module
Uses *needleman_wunsch module* and *glorious_path module* to align two strings. 
Based on glorious path, generates two strings visually representing the alignment of the inputed strings.

<br></br>
### Other modules
Other modules are there to generate some random samples and print the results on screen. 
These modules implement [producer/consumer pattern](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3110/2010fa/lectures/lec18.html).
